  { timestamp: "0:00", text: "Welcome everyone, today we're going to build a simple todo list application in React." },
  { timestamp: "0:05", text: "This is a great beginner project to understand React fundamentals." },
  { timestamp: "0:10", text: "Let me create a new components folder to organize our code." },
  { timestamp: "0:15", text: "I'll create a new file called TodoList.jsx inside the components folder." },
  { timestamp: "0:20", text: "Now let's start by creating a functional component. I'll type function TodoList." },
  { timestamp: "0:25", text: "And we need to export this component so we can use it in other files." },
  { timestamp: "0:30", text: "I'll add export default at the beginning. This makes it the default export from this file." },
  { timestamp: "0:35", text: "Inside the function, we'll return some JSX. Let me add a return statement." },
  { timestamp: "0:40", text: "For now, let's just return a div with an h1 that says Todo List." },
  { timestamp: "0:45", text: "Now we need to make this interactive. React components need state to handle changing data." },
  { timestamp: "0:50", text: "Let me import useState from React at the top of the file." },
  { timestamp: "0:55", text: "useState is a React Hook that lets us add state to functional components." },
  { timestamp: "1:00", text: "Now I'll create a state variable for our todos. const todos, setTodos equals useState." },
  { timestamp: "1:05", text: "We'll initialize it with an empty array since we don't have any todos yet." },
  { timestamp: "1:10", text: "We also need state for the input field. Let me create another state variable." },
  { timestamp: "1:15", text: "const inputValue, setInputValue equals useState with an empty string." },
  { timestamp: "1:20", text: "Now let's add an input field to our JSX so users can type new todos." },
  { timestamp: "1:25", text: "I'll add an input element with type text." },
  { timestamp: "1:30", text: "This input needs to be controlled, so I'll set its value to inputValue." },
  { timestamp: "1:35", text: "And we need an onChange handler to update the state when the user types." },
  { timestamp: "1:40", text: "onChange equals an arrow function that takes the event parameter." },
  { timestamp: "1:45", text: "Inside, we'll call setInputValue with e.target.value." },
  { timestamp: "1:50", text: "Now let's add a button to add new todos. I'll create an Add button." },
  { timestamp: "1:55", text: "We need a function to handle adding todos. Let me create handleAddTodo." },
  { timestamp: "2:00", text: "This function will update our todos state by creating a new array with the new todo." },
  { timestamp: "2:05", text: "We'll use the spread operator to create a new array with all existing todos plus the new one." },
  { timestamp: "2:10", text: "setTodos, and inside we'll spread the current todos and add a new object." },
  { timestamp: "2:15", text: "Each todo needs an id, so I'll use Date.now() for a simple unique identifier." },
  { timestamp: "2:20", text: "And the text property will be the inputValue from our state." },
  { timestamp: "2:25", text: "After adding, we should clear the input, so setInputValue to empty string." },
  { timestamp: "2:30", text: "Let me connect this function to our button with an onClick handler." },
  { timestamp: "2:35", text: "Now we need to display our todos. I'll add a ul element below the input." },
  { timestamp: "2:40", text: "To render the list, we'll use the map method on our todos array." },
  { timestamp: "2:45", text: "todos.map takes a function that receives each todo item." },
  { timestamp: "2:50", text: "For each todo, we'll return an li element." },
  { timestamp: "2:55", text: "React needs a unique key prop for each list item to efficiently update the DOM." },
  { timestamp: "3:00", text: "I'll use todo.id as the key since we made sure it's unique." },
  { timestamp: "3:05", text: "Inside the li, we'll display the todo.text." },
  { timestamp: "3:10", text: "Let's also add a delete button for each todo." },
  { timestamp: "3:15", text: "I'll add a button element inside each li after the text." },
  { timestamp: "3:20", text: "For the delete functionality, we need to pass the todo id to know which one to delete." },
  { timestamp: "3:25", text: "onClick needs an arrow function that calls handleDelete with the todo.id." },
  { timestamp: "3:30", text: "Now let me create the handleDelete function." },
  { timestamp: "3:35", text: "To delete a todo, we'll filter the array to exclude the one with the matching id." },
  { timestamp: "3:40", text: "setTodos with todos.filter, checking if todo.id is not equal to the id parameter." },
  { timestamp: "3:45", text: "This creates a new array without the deleted todo, which triggers a re-render." },
  { timestamp: "3:50", text: "Let's test our application. I'll save the file and check if everything works." },
  { timestamp: "3:55", text: "Great! We can add todos, see them in the list, and delete them." },
  { timestamp: "4:00", text: "This demonstrates key React concepts: components, state, event handling, and rendering lists." },
  { timestamp: "4:05", text: "The important thing to understand is how React's state management works." },
  { timestamp: "4:10", text: "Every time we call setState, React re-renders the component with the new data." },
  { timestamp: "4:15", text: "And by using immutable updates, React can efficiently determine what changed." },
  { timestamp: "4:20", text: "That's why we use spread operator and filter instead of mutating the array directly." },
  { timestamp: "4:25", text: "This pattern of immutable state updates is fundamental to React development." },
  { timestamp: "4:30", text: "In a real application, you might want to add features like editing todos or marking them complete." },
  { timestamp: "4:35", text: "But this basic structure gives you the foundation to build upon." },
  { timestamp: "4:40", text: "Remember, React is all about breaking your UI into reusable components with their own state and logic." },
  { timestamp: "4:45", text: "Thanks for following along! Practice building variations of this to solidify these concepts." },
  { timestamp: "4:50", text: "Let me show you a few more advanced features you could add to this todo list." },
  { timestamp: "4:55", text: "For example, you might want to add the ability to edit existing todos." },
  { timestamp: "5:00", text: "To do that, you'd need to track which todo is being edited in your state." },
  { timestamp: "5:05", text: "You could add an isEditing property to each todo object." },
  { timestamp: "5:10", text: "Then conditionally render either the text or an input field based on that property." },
  { timestamp: "5:15", text: "Another common feature is marking todos as complete." },
  { timestamp: "5:20", text: "You'd add a completed boolean property to each todo." },
  { timestamp: "5:25", text: "Then use conditional styling to show completed todos differently, maybe with a strikethrough." },
  { timestamp: "5:30", text: "You could also add filters to show all, active, or completed todos." },
  { timestamp: "5:35", text: "This would involve creating a filter state and using it when rendering the list." },
  { timestamp: "5:40", text: "For persistence, you might want to save todos to localStorage." },
  { timestamp: "5:45", text: "You'd use useEffect to save whenever todos change, and load them on component mount." },
  { timestamp: "5:50", text: "Let's also talk about some common mistakes beginners make with React." },
  { timestamp: "5:55", text: "One mistake is directly mutating state instead of creating new objects or arrays." },
  { timestamp: "6:00", text: "Always remember that React needs to see a new reference to trigger re-renders." },
  { timestamp: "6:05", text: "Another mistake is forgetting the key prop when rendering lists." },
  { timestamp: "6:10", text: "React uses keys to efficiently update the DOM when list items change." },
  { timestamp: "6:15", text: "Also, be careful about using array indexes as keys if the list can be reordered." },
  { timestamp: "6:20", text: "It's better to use stable, unique IDs like we did with Date.now()." },
  { timestamp: "6:25", text: "Some beginners also forget to prevent form submission when handling forms." },
  { timestamp: "6:30", text: "Always call e.preventDefault() in your form submit handlers." },
  { timestamp: "6:35", text: "Let's talk about component composition and when to split components." },
  { timestamp: "6:40", text: "Our TodoList component is getting quite large with all this functionality." },
  { timestamp: "6:45", text: "In a real application, you might split it into smaller components." },
  { timestamp: "6:50", text: "For example, TodoItem could be its own component that receives props." },
  { timestamp: "6:55", text: "This makes your code more modular and easier to test." },
  { timestamp: "7:00", text: "You could also have a TodoForm component for the input and add button." },
  { timestamp: "7:05", text: "This separation of concerns makes your code more maintainable." },
  { timestamp: "7:10", text: "When passing functions as props, be mindful of performance." },
  { timestamp: "7:15", text: "Creating new functions in render can cause unnecessary re-renders of child components." },
  { timestamp: "7:20", text: "In performance-critical apps, you might use useCallback to memoize functions." },
  { timestamp: "7:25", text: "But don't optimize prematurely - React is quite fast even without these optimizations." },
  { timestamp: "7:30", text: "Let's also discuss state management as your app grows." },
  { timestamp: "7:35", text: "For simple apps like this, component state with useState is perfect." },
  { timestamp: "7:40", text: "But as your app grows, you might need more sophisticated state management." },
  { timestamp: "7:45", text: "You could use Context API for sharing state between components." },
  { timestamp: "7:50", text: "Or for very complex apps, consider libraries like Redux or Zustand." },
  { timestamp: "7:55", text: "The key is to choose the right tool for your specific needs." },
  { timestamp: "8:00", text: "Don't add complexity until you actually need it." },
  { timestamp: "8:05", text: "Now let's talk about testing React components." },
  { timestamp: "8:10", text: "You should test that your components render correctly and handle user interactions." },
  { timestamp: "8:15", text: "React Testing Library is great for testing components from a user's perspective." },
  { timestamp: "8:20", text: "Test the behavior, not the implementation details." },
  { timestamp: "8:25", text: "For our todo list, you'd test adding todos, deleting them, and any other features." },
  { timestamp: "8:30", text: "Good tests give you confidence when refactoring or adding new features." },
  { timestamp: "8:35", text: "Let me also mention accessibility considerations." },
  { timestamp: "8:40", text: "Always use semantic HTML elements like button, not divs with onClick." },
  { timestamp: "8:45", text: "Add proper labels to form inputs for screen reader users." },
  { timestamp: "8:50", text: "Consider keyboard navigation - can users tab through your interface?" },
  { timestamp: "8:55", text: "These details make your app usable by everyone." },
  { timestamp: "9:00", text: "As we wrap up, remember that React is just JavaScript." },
  { timestamp: "9:05", text: "The better you understand JavaScript, the better you'll be with React." },
  { timestamp: "9:10", text: "Keep practicing, build lots of small projects, and gradually increase complexity." },
  { timestamp: "9:15", text: "Thanks again for watching this React todo list tutorial." },
